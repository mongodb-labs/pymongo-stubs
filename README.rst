==================================================
pymongo-stubs: Experimental stub files for PyMongo
==================================================

Experimental stub files for `PyMongo`_ 3.

**pymongo-stubs is NOT an officially supported MongoDB product.**

Example

Installation
============

pymongo-stubs can be installed with `pip`_::

  $ python3 -m pip install pymongo-stubs

Installing from source
----------------------

pymongo-stubs' source code is hosted on Github: `mongodb-labs/pymongo-stubs`_.
To install pymongo-stubs from source::

  $ git clone git@github.com:mongodb/pymongo-stubs.git
  $ python3 -m pip install ./pymongo-stubs

Dependencies
============

pymongo-stubs is compatible with Python >=3.6 and `PyMongo`_ >=3.11,<4.0.

Roadmap
=======

pymongo-stubs adds support for type checking `PyMongo`_ 3.X code. This project
will not support PyMongo 4. Instead, PyMongo 4 will add inline type
annotations (in `PYTHON-2432`_) which removes the need to maintain stub files.
This project will reach end-of-life when `PYTHON-2432`_ is completed or when
MongoDB drops support for `PyMongo`_ 3.X.

Support / Feedback
==================

pymongo-stubs is experimental and is not an officially supported MongoDB product.

`MongoDB Community Forums`_.
